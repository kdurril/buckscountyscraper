## Mapping

**overview**
Mapping a complex documents is work. Even having a visually styled document to work from is only so helpful. 

My goal is generally to have a serachable document on which I can also aggregate labeled fields. I keep a copy of the original document as I recieved it for reproducibility. Searching generally means having a text representation of the document.

However, a variety of data is repeated for readability in documents I've worked with. Choices about what to include in a key-value redering.
